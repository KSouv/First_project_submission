This will be my first project to submit!
I recently graduated with a masters in Statistics. I am currently looking for a job in the Data Science space. While I don't have a job yet, I thought I should spend my time reinforcing my coding skills and geting some indepth knowledge on Machine Learning through a projects' based training.
